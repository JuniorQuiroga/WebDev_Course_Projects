                            Nathan John Feuerstein<br>
                            Born in Gladwin, Michigan, on March 30, 1991.<br> 
                            His parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother until his father had to take him 
                            away when her boyfriend abused him. His mother died from an overdose in 2009 which led 
                            to him dedicating the song "How Could You Leave Us" to her.<br>
                            He graduated from Gladwin High School in 2009, and was on the basketball team. 
                            NF started his career at the Fine Arts Festival organized by Connection Church in Canton, 
                            Michigan.
